==================================

## Index

1. Requirements  
1.1 Installing the required applications on GNU/Linux  
1.2 Installing the required applications on Windows  
2. Manually downloading and installing Qt ARMSim  


1. Requirements
---------------

Qt ARMSim requires the following applications:

  * [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
  * [PyQt4 for Python3](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro)
  * [QScintilla](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/qscintilla/intro)

QScintilla sometimes is already distributed with the PyQt4
installation. If this is the case, it is not necessary to install it
separately.

ARMSim requires the following application:

  * [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)


### 1.1 Installing the required applications on GNU/Linux

The GNU/Linux major distributions provide packages for Python3, PyQt4,
QScintilla (if not bundled with PyQt4), and Ruby. You should use the
package manager of your GNU/Linux distribution to install PyQt4 for
Python3 (the package manager will take care of its dependencies and
also install Python3 if it is not already installed); QScintilla with
python bindings, if offered as a separate package; and Ruby.

For example, in Gentoo, you can use:

	# emerge -av PyQt4 qscintilla-python ruby


### 1.2 Installing the required applications on Windows

Windows support has been tested with PyQt4 for Python 3.3. It should
work on newer versions, just make sure that you get the PyQt4 binary
package for the python version that you have installed.

To install Qt ARMSim, and ARMSim dependencies on Windows, please
follow the next steps:

1. Download and install
[Python 3.3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (either 32
or 64 bits version). If you want to install a newer Python version,
just check that there is a PyQt binary package for that version.

2. Download and install the binary package of
[PyQt4 for Python 3.3](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download)
(either 32 or 64 bits, the same as the Python one).

3. Download and install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).


2. Manually downloading and installing Qt ARMSim
------------------------------------------------

Qt ARMSim can be downloaded from
[http://lorca.act.uji.es/projects/qtarmsim](http://lorca.act.uji.es/projects/qtarmsim).

To install Qt ARMSim first uncompress the `qtarmsim-x.y.z.tar.gz`
package and enter in the `qtarmsim-x.y.z` directory.

	$ tar -xzf qtarmsim-x.y.z.tar.gz
	$ cd qtarmsim-x.y.z

Once there, you can install Qt ARMSim system wide or on a user
basis. To install it system wide, you should use the following command
as `root`:

	# python3 setup.py install

The executable will be installed on a system accessible path. To
launch Qt ARMSim you can use the command `qtarmsim`.

If you prefer to install Qt ARMSim on a user basis, you should execute
the following command:

	$ python3 setup.py install --user

The executable will be installed on a local user path. On GNU/Linux it
is installed on `~/.local/bin/`. To launch Qt ARMSim you can use the
command:

	$ ~/local/bin/qtarmsim
