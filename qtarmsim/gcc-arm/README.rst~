ABOUT THIS DIRECTORY
====================

This directory contains a reduced set of the GNU compiler toolchain
targeting the ARM EABI platform used by the Maple IDE distributed by
LeafLabs (http://leaflabs.com). It is distributed alongside with
QtARMSim to avoid the need of installing a complete GNU compiler
toolchain targeting the ARM EABI platform.

The original README files, describing the software license and where
to find the correspondent source code have been kept in case you are
interested on getting the whole version.

The complete set of files were downloaded from:
''https://code.google.com/p/arduino/downloads/list'':

Linux32: gcc-arm-none-eabi-4.4.1-2010q1-188-linux32.tar.gz
Win32:   gcc-arm-none-eabi-4.4.1-2010q1-188-win32.tar.gz
MacOS:   gcc-arm-none-eabi-4.4.1-2010q1-188-macos.tar.gz

To keep a low storage fingerprint, only those files that are required
to perform the next gcc command have been kept under each directory:

  bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-m1 -mthumb -c test.s

On GNU/Linux, the ''strace'' command was used to find the required
files and their path.
