0.5.4 (2021-05-27)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fixed incompatibility with Ruby 3.0.

0.5.3 (2020-11-06)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Updated the installation instructions.
- A newer 64 bit GNU GCC Arm toolchain for macOS has been included.

0.5.2 (2020-06-20)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Updated the installation instructions.
- Updated post installation hook for linux.
- Post installation code reorganized to allow post_install to be installed as a script.

0.5.1 (2020-06-13)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Reformatted post_install code and added a hook for linux.
- Changed default QtARMSim icon by the SVG version.
- Moved post_install.py script outside of qtarmsim module to avoid its dependency on PySide2 (under certain circumstances, post-install is called before the PySide2 dependency is installed).

0.5.0 (2020-05-25)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Visualization improvements, especially on the trace ribbon (left area of the simulator).
- The registers at the register dock are now highlighted when a register is highlighted in the editor or in the simulator.
- Added Full Screen mode.
- Added new Compact layout. Hides everything but the registers and memory docks (which are stacked at the left) and the Edit/Simulation widget (which takes the rest of the window).
- The ARMSim path and GNU compiler path are tested on initialization. If they are no longer valid (usually due to a system python update), they are replaced by their default values.
- Improved the QtARMSim installation and integration on GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS. On GNU/Linux, the KDE expected mime type for assembler editors has been added. On Windows, a menu entry and a desktop shortcut are now created. On macOS, the qtarmsim script is automatically copied on /opt/local/bin/.
- Added a simulator output panel that displays the stdout of ARMSim (available only in debug mode).
- Fixed a bug in ARMSim due to GCC trimming the lines of the LST file at a fixed number of bytes, which under certain circumstances could lead to split a multi byte UTF-8 character and provoke an exception.

0.4.19 (2020-05-05)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fixed bug: 'QPaintDevice: Cannot destroy paint device that is being painted'.
- Updated ARMSim version.

0.4.18 (2020-05-05)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fixed bug: assigning a PIPE to armsim stdout prevented the Windows version to work properly.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Updated installation instructions for Windows systems.

0.4.16 (2019-11-08)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added the Show/Hide tabs and spaces functionality (on the editor contextual menu).
- Saved files are forced to end with a new line (to avoid misleading the gcc compiler if the last line ended with a TAB).
- Added zoom in and zoom out via CTRL++ and CTRL+- (CTRL+wheel already was there).
- Tab width is now correctly computed.

0.4.15 (2019-07-15)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-  Added the ``printf`` subroutine to the ARMSim firmware.

0.4.12 (2019-04-24)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.4.11 (2019-01-21)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- PySide2 5.12 has changed the signature of QAbstractItemModel.createIndex(), as it seems that they are going to do a regression, the INSTALL documentation has been changed to force the installation of the previous 5.11.2 version of PySide2.

0.4.10 (2018-11-20)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added an scroll area inside the LCD Display dock widget (so that the LCD width does not force the whole simulator width).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Corrected typo on the restructured text format of the changelog documentation.

0.3.15 (2018-1-17)

0.3.7 (2016-09-18)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added firmware ROM that provides, among others, functions to display
  strings and numbers on the LCD display. The new memory organization
  consists of two ROM blocks and two RAM blocks. The first ROM block
  is filled with the assembled user code. The second ROM, with the
  firmware machine code. The first RAM can be used to store the user
  program data. The second RAM is used by the LCD display.
- The graphical interface now uses a thread to retrieve the memory
  contents and the disassembled code from the two ROM blocks.
- The regular expressions used to highlight the code on the editors
  have been optimized to increase the highlighting process speed.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Improved the Mac OS X compatibility and added installation
  instructions for this platform.
- Changed the minimum size of the code editor container to accommodate
  lower resolution screens.
- ARMSim: (i) LSL result is now bounded to 32 bits; (ii) command
  redirection is performed explicitly to avoid an error on newer
  Windows versions; and (iii) the method used to compare whether
  memory blocks where not defined has been changed to avoid errors on
  Ruby with version >= 2.3.

0.3.4 (2016-01-21)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added a memory dump dock widget that allows to see and edit the
  memory at byte level. It also shows the ASCII equivalent of each
  byte.
- Added a LCD display dock widget that provides a simple output
  system. It has a size of 32x6 and each character is mapped to a
  memory position starting a 0x20070000.

0.3.3 (2015-11-28)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added a visual indication of which instructions have already been
  executed on the left margin of the ARMSim panel.
- Added automatic scroll on simulation mode in order to keep the next
  line that is going to be executed visible.
- Improved the automatic selection of a mono spaced font (previously
  selected font used ligatures).
- Fixed an error on the Preferences Dialog which prevented to select
  the ``ARMSim directory`` and the ``Gcc ARM command line`` using the
  corresponding directory/file selector dialogs.
- ARMSim: Fixed the simulation of shift instructions: only the 8 least
  significant bits are now used to obtain the shift amount.
- ARMSim.: Fixed the behavior when memory outside the current memory
  map is accessed: each wrong access now raises a memory access error.
- Bundled a reduced set of the GNU compiler toolchain. To reduce the
  package size, only those files actually required to assemble an
  assembly source code have been included.

0.3.0 (2015-06-09)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Migrated from PyQt to PySide to allow a simpler installation of
  QtARMSim.
- Developed a new source code editor based on QPlainTextEdit, though
  removing the prior QScintilla dependency, which allows a simpler
  installation of QtARMSim.
- Improved the ARM Assembler syntax highlighting.

0.2.7 (2014-11-05)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Last revision of the first functional QtARMSim implementation. This
  implementation  was used on the first semester of an introductory
  course on Computer Architecture at Jaume I University. This is the
  last version of that implementation, which used PyQt and QScintilla.
